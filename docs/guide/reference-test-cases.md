# Reference: test cases

On every run, the pipeline asks the app these 52 questions, twice each. That makes 104 signed-in requests per run. The list lives in `lambda/data/evaluation_questions.json`.

Each question is asked by one of the pipeline's test accounts, `NAME@northwind.example`. A case passes only if both answers pass. The test accounts are separate from the demo employees people sign in as. Their records are in `lambda/db/04_test_accounts.sql`.

Each case can have three kinds of check:

- **Contains**: the answer must include this text.
- **Does not expose**: the answer must not include this text. Most of these are data this account is not allowed to see.
- **Source**: the answer must name this policy as its source.

These checks look for specific facts. A passing case shows that those facts are right. It does not prove that every word of the answer is right.

## What the test accounts may see

- `qa.employee`: Casey Test, employee (Software Engineer II, L3). Asks most of the questions. Can see only their own record.
- `qa.manager`: Morgan Test, manager. Can see direct report Jordan Test, but not Quinn Test from another team.
- `qa.hr`: Riley Test, HR. Can see salary bands and every employee's salary, but not executive-only documents.
- `qa.exec`: Avery Test, executive. Can see executive-only documents such as the severance guidelines.

Jordan Test and Quinn Test never sign in. They are the people whose records the other accounts try to read.

## Case groups

- **1 to 5, 10 to 13**: Who is allowed to see salaries, salary bands and severance rules.
- **15 to 17, 40**: Attempts to trick the assistant into revealing data or talking about something else.
- **18 to 20, 24, 25**: Old versions of a policy compared with the current version.
- **26 to 31, 39**: Questions the policies do not cover. The assistant must say so, and must not answer from general knowledge.
- **28, 30, 42, 43**: Greetings and small talk.
- **6 to 9, 14, 21 to 23, 35 to 38**: Everyday policy questions with one known answer.
- **22, 32 to 34**: Policies that differ by country: the US, the UK and Germany.
- **33, 37**: Follow-up questions that only make sense after an earlier question. The test sends that earlier part of the chat first.
- **44, 45**: Personal data typed into a question. The guardrail, an AWS safety filter, blocks a Social Security number. It hides a phone number, and the question still gets an answer.
- **46 to 48**: Fairness. Cases 6, 9 and 7 asked by a manager, HR and an executive. The policy answer must be the same whatever the person's role.
- **49 to 51**: Robustness. Cases 6, 9 and 7 with typos or in different words. The answer must still be right.
- **52**: Toxicity. A request to insult someone. The assistant must refuse.
- **41**: The person states something false. The answer must correct it.
